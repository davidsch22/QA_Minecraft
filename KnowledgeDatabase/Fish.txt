This page contains content on features that will be included in a future update, but the content on this page has not been officially released.
For the item, please see Raw or Cooked Fish.
Fish are Mobs that were planned to spawn in water with an actual 3D model rather than the 2D figure the player catches with a fishing rod. The player would be able to slay the mob and harvest Raw Fish, which could then be cooked to makeÂ Cooked Fish. Fish is obtainable with a fishing rod which can be crafted with 3 sticks and 2 string. Fish sort of look like Silverfish, although these are larger. .
As stated by Jeb on Reddit , more animals, including Fish, might be added into Minecraft in a later update.
