 Mooshrooms are passive mobs introduced in the Minecraft Beta 1.9 Pre-Release. When a player right-clicks a mooshroom with shears, they drop red mushrooms and will transform into a regular cow. There is also a rare chance that it will split into two cows when sheared. If one uses an empty bowl on a mooshroom, the bowl becomes filled with mushroom stew. This can be used as an infinite food source. If a mooshroom is killed, it will drop the same items as a regular cow. Mooshrooms will only spawn in Mushroom biomes, and as of Minecraft 1.0.0, they will sometimes spawn on generated Mushroom Islands. Like cows, mooshrooms will follow players holding wheat, and enter love mode if fed it.
Mooshrooms resemble ordinary cows, but are red with white spots and have Red Mushrooms on their backs and heads. Another difference is their eyes; while cows contain the whites of their eyes, Mooshrooms' eyes are completely  black.
When a Mooshroom is sheared, a ring of smoke forms around it for 0.8 seconds.
The Mooshroom is the only breedable mob excluded from the PS3 tutorial world that has been implemented in the PS3 edition.
