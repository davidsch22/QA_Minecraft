Pigs are rideable passive mobs.
Pigs spawn on grass blocks at a light level of 9 or more. Herds of pigs spawn upon world generation.
Pigs drop 1 to 3 pieces of raw porkchop (1-3 units of cooked porkchop if killed while on fire). Baby pigs don't drop anything. Pigs also drop 1-3 experience when killed by a player or tamed wolf. They also drop saddles if saddled.
Pigs are 0.875 blocks tall, 0.650 blocks wide and 1.3 blocks long.
Pigs typically roam the Overworld in groups of 3 - 4.
Pigs act similarly to other passive mobs; they will wander aimlessly, avoiding falling off cliffs high enough to cause fall damage, and will usually stay out of water. Pigs will follow any player who is carrying a carrot or carrot on a stick, and will stop following if the player moves over approximately 5 blocks away from the pig. Pigs will also randomly oink.
When struck by lightning, pigs turn into zombie pigmen.
Pigs can be bred using carrots. It takes about 5 minutes before the parents can be bred once more, which applies to all farm animals. It takes at least one full Minecraft 'day' (20 minutes or more) for piglets to mature. The appearance of a piglet is roughly similar to that of an adult pig, having the same sized heads, but noticeably smaller bodies. Piglets mostly stay around their parents until they mature, although the parents cannot protect the piglet(s) from harm. In Pocket Edition, pigs can also be bred with potatoes and beetroots.
The growth of baby pigs can be slowly accelerated using carrots. Each use takes 10% off the remaining time to grow up.
Saddled pigs are controllable with a carrot on a stick. They start slow but end up going 4.00 m/s. Pigs do not respond to carrots after entering a body of water. Pigs "eat" the carrot in a span of time which is shown by a durability bar on the carrot on a stick. Using the carrot on a stick will cause them to have a burst of speed but take the durability off it by one quarter of the health. It is not necessary to hold the carrot on a stick while the pig is having the burst of speed. Damage is taken by the part that was hit; fall damage is taken by the pig. However, it does not cause any knockback nor any decrease of movement speed.
Saddled pigs in minecarts behave strangely If the player mounts the pig and uses the opposite controls for direction, the speed of the minecart will be boosted to the same speed as a minecart travelling on powered rails.
Saddled pigs in minecarts behave strangely The minecart, ridden or not, will not come to a stop unless it hits a block. Other entities and unpowered gold rails will only slow it to a minimum speed.
Saddled pigs in minecarts behave strangely Also, if you sit on a saddled pig in a minecart that isn't on a track, you are able to control the minecart and drive it around like a car (although it is very slow).
One of the splashes which shows up on the title screen reads "Ride the pig!".
The house-music artist deadmau5 released a song titled "Get In The Cart, Pig", in a direct reference to Minecraft.
