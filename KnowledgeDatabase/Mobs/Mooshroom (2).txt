Mooshrooms are unique variations of cows.
Mooshrooms spawn on mycelium blocks in mushroom island biomes in herds of 4 to 8.
If a pair of mooshrooms are given wheat, they will breed.
Feeding wheat to a baby mooshroom will speed up its growing time by 10% of the remaining time.
Mooshrooms drop 0-2 leather and 1-3 raw beef (1-3 steak if killed while on fire). Shearing one will drop 5 red mushrooms and turn the mooshroom into a normal cow, emitting smoke particles. Mooshrooms also drop 1-3 experience when killed by a player or tamed wolf.
Besides giving milk, mooshrooms can be milked with bowls to give mushroom stew.
Mooshrooms are 1.6875 blocks tall, 0.625 blocks wide, and 1.5 blocks long.
Mooshrooms tend to walk around slowly and aimlessly, breathing and mooing occasionally. They also tend to jump off high cliffs and make no attempt to stay out of water. During a rain or thunderstorm, mooshrooms can be seen taking cover under structures or trees to avoid getting wet.
A mooshroom will follow players holding wheat, and in doing so may run off cliffs and into damaging blocks.
The name "Mooshroom" is a portmanteau for "moo" (which itself is an onomatopoeia of a cow's sound) and "mushroom".
