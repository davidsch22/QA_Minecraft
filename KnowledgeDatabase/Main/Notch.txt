Markus Alexej "Notch" Persson is a Swedish video game programmer best known as the creator of Minecraft and the owner of Mojang AB.
Markus Persson (Notch) was born in Stockholm, Sweden and lived there for the first eight years of his life. He began programming on a Commodore 128 home computer at the age of seven. Having experimented with various type-in programs he produced his first game at the age of eight, a text-based adventure game. Professionally, he had worked as a game developer for King.com for over four years, until 2009. Afterwards he worked as a programmer for Jalbum. He is also one of the founders of Wurm Online, although he no longer works on this game. Outside of work, he has made seven games for competitions for the Java 4K Game Programming Contest such as "Left 4K Dead" and "Mega 4K Man". He has also entered the Ludum Dare competition. He is the central figure of a documentary in development about the rise of Minecraft and Mojang called Minecraft: The story of Mojang. Fans believe he has a dead brother called Herobrine that haunts the game. (Markus has confirmed that this is nothing more than a rumor).
Persson was at a time married to Elin Zetterstrand (Kristoffer Zetterstrand's sister) for two years until August 16th, 2012, when he stated that he was single again.
Notch has released almost all of his work.
His newer games developed with Mojang includeÂ Scrolls and Cobalt.
When killed in-game, he drops an apple. He is the only player in the whole of Minecraft who does this (unless a player is killed while carrying apples).
On September 15, 2014, Notch declared that he will leave Mojang.
