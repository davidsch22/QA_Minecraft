Developer calls and URLs found by googling "site:minecraft.net" (Also posted on minecraftforum).
Used to download resources for the client and for the server up to version 1.5.2.
Used to download resources for the client past version 1.6.2.
Used to check if an account is premium or not. Returns true if the username is a premium Minecraft account, returns false otherwise.
The Minecraft launcher uses this to authenticate logins. If the username and password are valid for a premium account, returns "<POSIX time>:<hash of password>:<username with correct capitalization>:<newly generated session id>:". If username and password are invalid, returns "Bad login". If the username and password are correct, but the account isn't premium, returns "User not premium". If the given version number is less than 12, returns "Old version". The username is not case-sensitive.
This link seems to be called when a server with online-mode=true checks if it should allow a player to join the game. The session ID is generated by the launcher when logging in (you can also generate them with the "getversion.jsp" link above). This URL will return "OK" if the given session ID is the last one to have been generated for that username; otherwise it will return a "Bad login" error.
Directs the user to a page where they can choose if they want to change their skin to <URL>.
Returns the skin for a given username. Case-sensitive, returns an XML access denied page if the skin doesn't exist.
Returns the cape for a given username. Behaves the same as above.
Returns a list of the latest game files that can be downloaded. The Minecraft launcher uses this to perform an update.
This is most likely used to create the classic server list. How the parameters work is unknown. Returns a link to a classic server page.
A test page that Mojang asked people to use as they worked on a new launcher for Minecraft. Runs a few processes in the browser, then starts a new version of the launcher, which will be downloaded to /.minecraft/launcher as launcher.jar.No longer works in Google Chrome and Chromium web browsers.
This link gives a glimpse at a future feature to Minecraft. This page says that, in the future, it will be possible to have Minecraft open and connect to the server IP specified in the URL when accessing this link.
