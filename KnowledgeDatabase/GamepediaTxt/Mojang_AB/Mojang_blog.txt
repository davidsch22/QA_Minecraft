Mojang.com is Mojang AB's official website. It contains a blog and information hub about their games, including the clothing produced by J!NX. The website serves as an official outlet for updates regarding Minecraft and their newly announced game, Scrolls. While it is not the sole source of updates, it also serves as a hub to other sources such as individual staff's Twitter feeds. It is currently run by Jeb, Carl and Kappische, however Jeb and Notch still maintain their own blogs related to Minecraft, such as The Word of Notch.
Previously, the site was largely a placeholder, with a short biography and links to Notch's other game projects. Around the same time as the new Mojang logo was put in place, it was transformed into a full site to showcase the company.
