Nathan 'Dinnerbone' Adams is a game developer at Mojang AB currently working on Minecraft. A member of the Bukkit team, Adams was hired by Mojang on 28 February 2012 to develop the mod API. His first day at the Mojang office was 27 March 2012, shortly before the first development snapshots for version 1.3.1.
A common trope attributed to Dinnerbone is that he is commonly displayed as being upside-down. His Twitter avatar is flipped and his user model, as well as any mob named "Dinnerbone", will be rendered upside-down.
Nathan Adams is originally from Shrewsbury, United Kingdom. He says he learned programming through creating MSN bots at age 10. After finishing secondary school, Dinnerbone was rejected from college, so he found a job with a tiny web development company but was made redundant after a few years. Shortly after starting Bukkit, Dinnerbone was hired by Curse where he worked until joining Mojang.

If you name any mob with a name tag with the name "Dinnerbone", the animal will flip upside down. This naturally extends to himself.
