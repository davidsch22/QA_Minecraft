Apples are food items that can be eaten by the player.
Oak and dark oak leaves have 0.5% (⁄200) chance of dropping an apple. This amounts to approximately 25% chance to get an apple from an oak tree and 60% chance from a dark oak tree. Breaking leaves with a tool enchanted with the fortune enchantment will increase the chances of dropping an apple: 0.556% (⁄180) with Fortune I, 0.625% (⁄160) with Fortune II, and 0.833% (⁄120) with Fortune III.
In the pocket edition, the chance is higher.
Apples can be found in chests found in strongholds and villages in stacks of 1 to 3, and in the bonus chest in stacks of 2 to 3.
Villager farmers may offer to sell apples in exchange for emeralds. 5 apples can be bought per emerald as one of their third tier trades.
To eat an apple, press and hold use while it is selected in the hotbar. Eating one restores 4 () (4 () in Pocket Edition) and 2.4 hunger saturation.
An apple can be used to craft a golden apple or an enchanted golden apple.
