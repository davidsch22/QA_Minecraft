Raw Chicken is a food item dropped by Chickens when killed. It has about a 30% chance to add hunger status (also called food poisoning) to the player when eaten. To avoid this, it must be cooked in a Furnace and turned into Cooked Chicken.
If killed by fire (including from enchanted weapons), the chicken will drop Cooked Chicken instead of Raw Chicken.
Raw Chicken and Rotten Flesh are the only foods that can cause food poisoning.
Food Poisoning can be cured by drinking Milk.
Raw Chicken won't cause food poisoning when eaten inÂ Minecraft: Pocket Edition, as there is no food poisoning in that edition.
