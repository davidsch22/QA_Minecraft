Minecart with Command Block is a command block inside a minecart.
Minecart with command block is only obtainable using commands. It can be broken like any other minecart, but the command block is lost.
The minecart with command block combines the functionalites of both minecarts and command blocks. It runs its command repeatedly (each 4 game ticks) when on an active activator rail. When it passes over a detector rail with a comparator connected next to it, it will output the command block's result.
