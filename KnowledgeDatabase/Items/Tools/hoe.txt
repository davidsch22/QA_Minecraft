A hoe is used to till grass and dirt blocks and turn it into farmland. It is crafted using 2 sticks and either 2 planks, cobblestone, iron ingots, gold ingots or diamonds. Unlike pickaxes and axes, hoes cannot be found in chests.
Grass and dirt is tilled by right clicking it while holding a hoe. It will then turn into farmland on which you can plant seeds. Farmland can be hydrated, which is done automatically when water is within 4 blocks from the farmland. Rain will also hydrate farmland, but this happens very slowly and is not a reliable way to keep the farmland hydrated.
The tilling of blocks happens instantly, so there is no point in making diamond, gold or even iron hoes. A stone hoe will allow you to till 60 blocks, which is usually enough for a large farm. Farmland will remain tilled forever if it’s hydrated, but will revert to dirt if it’s dehydrated. Jumping on farmland will also revert it back to a dirt block.
Hoes are terrible weapons. All of them only do half a heart of damage, which is the same as the damage of fists, but they’ll take double durability damage when used this way.
It’s impossible to enchant a hoe.
Like most tools, hoes have a durability determined by the material they’re made of. It’s possible to combine 2 damaged hoes of the same type in any crafting interface to create a new hoe of the same type with the durability of the old ones added together, plus 10%.
