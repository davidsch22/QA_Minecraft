A Minecart with Hopper is a hopper inside a minecart.
Minecarts with hoppers can be broken by attacking them.
These minecarts are placed similarly to other minecarts.
A Minecart with hopper will take in items which are lying nearby (range only slightly larger than the cart itself), or inside a container above the track (aprox. 18.5 items per second). It will also pick up items that are lying on a block directly above the track. It will not push items into containers, but a hopper underneath the track can take items out of it.
The hopper can be disabled by passing over a powered activator rail, and can be reenabled by an inactive activator rail.
A minecart with hopper will travel more than 85 blocks without stopping (as opposed to a normal cart going less than 12 blocks) from a dead stop using a 2 powered track starter even with another cart in front of them. However, the distance travelled by a Minecart with Hopper itself is heavily dependent on the hopper's load. Using a 1 powered rail starter track, a minecart with an empty hopper will travel 64 blocks until it stops (as opposed to an empty normal minecart going 8 blocks). The distance travelled diminishes non-linearly with increased hopper load; a minecart with a full hopper will only travel 16 blocks in this setup.
