 The Anvil is an interactive block that is used to repair items and rename a certain block or item, and combine enchantments on items. The anvil also obeys physics similar to Sand and Gravel however, if an Anvil lands on a un-solid block, such as Sand and Gravel, it will turn into a drop item. If the Anvil lands on a mob or player, it will deal damage relative to how far it fell before hitting the mob or player. Anvils have three states of damage: Normal anvil, slightly damaged anvil, and very damaged anvil. Whenever the Anvil is used, it has a 12% chance of being damaged. Also, dropping the Anvil onto any solid block has a chance to also do damage to it. Despite being able to fall, it cannot be pushed by pistons, making the creation of anvil traps difficult. To do so a single piston is required to have its extended arm beneath the anvil. .
Anvils are special interactive blocks. The original purpose of anvils was to restore items to their original durability. However, later, anvils were able to combine enchantments on items, which became extremely useful for creating powerful weapons and items. Anvils can also be used to rename objects into whatever the player would like to name it. However, all features take up experience to complete the task. Renaming objects reduces the cost of all later work done on the renamed object in the PS3 edition. Also, anvils can be dropped onto players, reducing damage, and most likely killing them.
If a spawn egg is renamed Dinnerbone or Grumm with an Anvil, the mobs spawned will be upside down. Note: This has been fixed as of 1.6.
