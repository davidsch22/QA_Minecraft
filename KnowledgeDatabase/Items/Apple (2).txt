An Apple is a type of food that refills . Apples were introduced to Minecraft in Indev 0.31. Originally, apples were extremely valuable items, being rarely found in only dungeon chests. In Minecraft 1.1, apples began to rarely (0.5% of the time) drop out from tree leaves.
In beta 1.4, along with Wolfs, it was planned to add green apples, though it was never implemented. Apples can be crafted into Golden Apples.
