Raw beef is a food item which can be eaten by the player, or cooked in a furnace to make steak.
Raw beef is dropped by cows and mooshrooms when they die. Each animal drops 1 to 3 raw beef. The Looting enchantment will increase the maximum number of possible raw beef drops by 1 per level.
Cows and mooshrooms that die while on fire will drop steak instead.
To eat raw beef, press and hold use while it is selected in the hotbar. Eating one restores 3 () hunger and 1.8 hunger saturation.
Raw beef can also be used to heal or breed tamed wolves.
In the Xbox 360 edition, the in-game description states that eating raw beef "can make you ill. Cook in a furnace." Despite this, eating raw beef has no effects on the player whatsoever.
