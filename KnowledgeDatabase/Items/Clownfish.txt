Clownfish are food items that are obtained by fishing.
The most common way of obtaining clownfish, like any other fish, is fishing. They are rare, as the chance of a catch is 2%. The chance of one being caught can be increased with the 'Lure' enchantment.
Another method of obtaining them is through defeating Guardians. This method is very inefficient, as the drop rate is roughly 0.05% (2.5 * 0.02).
One clownfish restores 1 () hunger and 0.2 hunger saturation.
Clownfish can be used to tame ocelots, like most other fish.
