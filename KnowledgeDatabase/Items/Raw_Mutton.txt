Raw Mutton is a food item that can be eaten by the player.
A sheep will drop 1â€“2 raw mutton upon death, unless it is on fire. More drops can be obtained using the looting enchantment.
To eat raw mutton, press and hold use while it is selected in the hotbar. Eating one restores 2 () hunger and 1.2 hunger saturation.
Raw mutton can also be used to heal or breed tamed wolves.
