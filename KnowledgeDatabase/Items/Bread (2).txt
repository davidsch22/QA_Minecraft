Bread is a food added in Indev, and available in Indev, Alpha, Beta and the Official Release. It is crafted from three Wheat.
Like all other Foods, Bread used to restore health, and restored a rate of 2.5 Hearts/Bread (Hearts per Bread). It did not stack back then, making storage of bread overly expansive.
With the introduction of the Hunger system, Bread was converted from restoring health to restoring hunger, keeping the same restoring value as before 1.8.
Wheat farming is reliable. Pigs and mushrooms are spawned randomly. Though both are relatively plentiful, it is more reliable to obtain food from a field of crops than to hunt for randomly generated entities.
A field of crops may be left to grow for 2â€“3 days while mining underground, then harvested and re-planted upon returning to the surface, ensuring a reliable source of food and allowing for relatively uninterrupted mining.
Farming may be slow at first, but in the end can be more efficient than farming mushrooms for mushroom stew.
Farming is safer in many cases as the farm can be placed in a guarded area close to a shelter. Fields can be safely harvested at night - to get grilled pork or mushrooms after sunset places the player at greater risk of being attacked by hostile mobs.
Early on, it is much easier to find wheat seeds, as merely breaking tall grass might give you wheat seeds. Carrots are much rarer, as they are a rare drop from Zombies and are found in NPC Villages, and Melons can only be found in abandoned Mineshafts or purchased through trading with NPC Villagers.
Farming can be lengthy. It takes creating a hoe, getting seeds, plotting a field, planting, and the wait to harvest.
It doesn't heal as much as a cooked porkchop or steak does, so more bread is needed.
When Compared to Carrots, Bread is less efficient space-wise and requires a crafting table to make, while Carrots do not.
Farming can be broken easily if it's hydrated but if it's non-hydrated it'll take a long time but rarely breaks, so you need to put fences just in case mobs tries to break your wheat.
Cake cannot be stacked and takes up far more space in the inventory.
Bread can usually be found in Dungeon chests and abandoned mineshaft Minecart with Chest.
Bread can be purchased from NPC Villagers.
