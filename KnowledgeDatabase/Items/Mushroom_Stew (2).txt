Mushroom Stew is a food item that is made by crafting a bowl and brown and red mushrooms. Eating it recovers 3 hunger points. You can also right-click a Mooshroom with a bowl in your hand and your bowl will be filled with stew, in the same manner as obtaining milk from a cow with a bucket. When the stew is eaten the empty bowl will be put into another stack or dropped if inventory is full.
