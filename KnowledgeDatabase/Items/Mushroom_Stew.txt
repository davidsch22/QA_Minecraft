Mushroom stew (or mushroom soup) is a food item.
Mushroom stew can be obtained by “milking” a mooshroom with an empty bowl. This is accomplished by using a bowl on a mooshroom. The bowl will be replaced with the mushroom stew item.
If a stack of more than one bowl is used on a mooshroom, only one bowl is consumed, and the mushroom stew will go into an empty inventory slot, or be dropped if the player's inventory is full.
A bowl of mushroom stew restores 6 () and 7.2 saturation points.
The bowl is returned to the player empty after the stew has been eaten, and can be re-used to craft more.
Note: Mushroom stew no longer restores 8 () hunger points, but 6 ().
