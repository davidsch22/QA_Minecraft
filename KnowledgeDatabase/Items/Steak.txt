Steak is a food item obtained from cows.
When a cow or mooshroom dies while on fire, it will drop one to three steak instead of raw beef. The Looting enchantment will increase the maximum number of steak drops by 1 per level.
Raw beef can be cooked in a furnace. Each steak removed from a furnace output slot gives 0.35 experience (22.4 experience per stack).
To eat steak, press and hold use while it is selected in the hotbar. Eating one restores 8 () hunger and 12.8 hunger saturation.
Steak can also be used to heal or breed tamed wolves.
