Cooked Chicken is obtained when Raw Chicken is cooked in a Furnace, or when a Chicken is killed in Fire. It restores  when eaten.
Can restore a good amount of hunger points.
Lots of saturation.
Chickens are farmed easily, plus when farming, theyÂ may occasionally lay eggs which will create more Chickens.
Chickens somewhat appear randomly and if you can't find one, no chicken.
They require seeds to breed.
Cooked chicken must be cooked in a furnace (8 cobblestone), and require some fuel or you would have to kill with fire.
Each chicken will always drop one raw chicken when killed, even if it is killed by a weapon with the looting enchantment (which makes other passive mobs drop more of their drops).
