Bricks are created by cooking clay in a furnace. Their only current purpose is to create brick blocks, a decorative building block.
Finding large quantities of clay can be a little tricky, but the best places to look are swamp biomes and shore lines. Especially swamp biomes are good, as the water is often shallow, which makes harvesting the clay a lot faster.
