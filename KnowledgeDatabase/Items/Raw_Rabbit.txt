Raw Rabbit is a food item that can be eaten by the player, or cooked in a furnace to make cooked rabbit.
Rabbits will drop raw rabbit upon death. 0-1 are dropped each time. The amount that is dropped is unaffected by the looting enchantment.
To eat raw rabbit, press and hold use while it is selected in the hotbar. Eating one restores 3 () hunger and 1.8 hunger saturation.
Raw rabbit can also be used to heal or breed tamed wolves.
