Pocket Edition Only.
Beetroots are crops exclusive to Pocket Edition which are not planned to be in the PC edition of Minecraft.
Beetroots are obtained from harvesting a fully grown crop block, which drops the crop and seeds in a similar manner to wheat.
Beetroots can be eaten to restore 1 () health.
Beetroots can be used to breed pigs by tapping and holding a pig with a beetroot in one's hand. Pigs also follow the player if the player is holding a beetroot.
