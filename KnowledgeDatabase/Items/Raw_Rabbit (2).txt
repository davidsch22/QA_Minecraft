Raw Rabbit is a food item added in Minecraft 1.8 and replenishes 1 and a half bars of hunger. It can be obtained by killing a Rabbit and 0-1 are dropped each time. If you put it in a Furnace and cook it, you'll get Cooked Rabbit.  Like Raw Chicken, the amount of raw rabbit that is dropped is unaffected by looting.
 Raw Rabbit and Raw Chicken are the only two foods that, when dropped by mobs, drop all their meat. Cows and pigs drop 1/4 of their meat.
