Particles are a graphical effect in Minecraft.
Particles always seem to face the player and will usually disappear after a short period of time. Particles collide with solid blocks and are slowed by cobwebs, but are unaffected by other entities.
The types of particles and their names in the game's code are displayed below. Particle names in italic will always be shown.
Most particle colors can be changed using resource packs, however the color of smoke particles used in redstone, portals, and Endermen can not be changed without mods.
Status effect particles will appear where your face is pointing.
Bubble and suspended particles seem to only appear when they are in water.
The "mobappearance" particle will always follow the player regardless of what its location has been set to.
The torches on redstone repeaters spawn particles, but the torches on redstone comparators do not.
