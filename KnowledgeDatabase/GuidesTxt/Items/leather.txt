Leather is obtained by killing cows and mooshrooms, which both drop 0-2 pieces of leather. It is currently only used to create leather armour, which is the weakest type of armour.
Leather armour hardly has any armour rating and although it’s better than nothing, iron armour is often aquired very early in game, sometimes even before a player has aquired the 24 pieces of leather it takes to craft a full set.
Farming leather is very easy. The easiest method is to simply breed cow, though if you don’t need a lot, traveling around a bit and killing every cow in sight will often get you enough leather.
