Diamonds are obtained by mining diamond ore, but can also be found in chests in villages, strongholds and abandoned mineshafts. An iron or diamond pickaxe is required to mine diamond ore. They are one of the rarest items in minecraft, as diamond ore can only be found in the bottom 17 layers of the map.
Diamonds are used to create the strongest armor, swords and tools, as well as jukeboxes, diamond blocks and enchantment tables.
