 A Redstone Repeater is a redstone block. It can act as a repeater, a diode, or a delay.
A repeater extends a powered redstone current by fifteen blocks. The repeater can delay this current by up to four tenths of a second. Repeaters will have their movable torch become a horizontal bar if powered from the side by another repeater, and stop responding to changes to the input block while in this state.
Prior to beta 1.6, the particles generated when the block was destroyed looked like those of a pumpkin .
In the codipear shorter is because the torches are actually off-set from their y-axis.
Two repeaters in a repeater lock.  Note how it is still powered even when the input has been disconnected.
