Redstone Comparators are a special redstone block that is  similar to redstone repeaters. Redstone comparators have a third torch on them, allowing for complex redstone features. Redstone comparators have three ports, with two being for input, the third for output. Redstone comparators also measure how many things an entity holds or weighs allowing for very interesting adventure maps. They also detect how many items are stored in a container block (such as a chest, hopper, dropper, or dispenser).
A tutorial on YouTube is available, showing on how to build with a redstone comparator.
