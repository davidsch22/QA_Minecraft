The Dragon egg was added in the Beta 1.9 pre-Release 6. It is an egg that is found and obtainable after defeating the Ender Dragon. Clicking on the egg can cause it to teleport to a nearby area (up to five blocks vertically and fifteen blocks horizontally), creating the teleport particles seen around endermen, nether portal and ender chests. Dragon eggs are like sand and gravel; falling when unsupported. Since they aren't opaque blocks, they cannot suffocate the player. To collect it you can: move the dragon egg with a piston; trap the egg with bedrock then mine it; or trap with bedrock, place a non-solid block (a torch works) under the block under the egg then mine the block under the egg, the egg should fall onto the torch and switch to item form. Or hit another block first then hit the dragon egg.You can have from 100 to 200 xp levels.
It has been said by Jeb that if red dragonsÂ were to ever be implemented, that the dragon egg may be a possible way of obtaining one.
Dragon eggs have no purpose in the game other than being a trophy and decoration.
 You should be able to spawn the Ender Dragon again by the 1.9 Combat Update, it is possible you can breed and ride it once you spawn it. .
