Trapped Chests are a redstone-related block that will emit a low redstone signal when a player opens it. As more players peer into the chest, the redstone signal will increase. Trapped chests can primarily be used to create traps, but can also create a few nifty redstone creations. Like standard Chests, two trapped chests can be put together to make a large (trapped) chest. They have a very faint red tint in some areas, suggesting the presence of redstone dust to the wary eye. If you want, you can strengthen the signal by putting a redstone repeater next to your trapped chest and to hide your chest you can put steps on top (or slabs).
Trapped chests work best as an anti-theft device. Trapped Chests can be used to trigger nearby TNT, with hopes of killing the unlucky soul who opens said chest. It could also drop an anvil, sand, or other potentially fatal physics blocks on the raider, using sticky pistons and a little bit of skill. Similarly, a dispenser will work just as well.
Trapped Chests can be made into double (large) Trapped Chests, and are able to be placed adjacent to normal chests without any interference, allowing two chests, or double chests, to be placed adjacent to each other.
 The Trapped Chest works exactly like a normal Chest, but can emit a redstone signal, used to create traps.
