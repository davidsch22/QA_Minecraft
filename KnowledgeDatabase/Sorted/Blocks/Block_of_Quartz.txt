 The Block of Quartz is a block added in 1.5 (released in Snapshot 13w01a.) that can be made from four pieces of Nether Quartz. A block of quartz currently has no use other than for decoration or use in building. It can be used as a white substitute to wool in building  (it will not burn).
Nether Quartz blocks can be crafted and used to craft other items.
Quartz was the only block that was in both PC and Pocket Edition but not in Xbox 360 edition until the latest update.
It is similar to Sandstone and Stone Bricks because of its many verieties (Chiseled, Pillar etc).
Unlike the Block of Iron, Block of Gold, Block of Diamond, Block of Redstone, and Block of Emerald, the block of quartz is crafted with four Nether Quartz instead of nine.
