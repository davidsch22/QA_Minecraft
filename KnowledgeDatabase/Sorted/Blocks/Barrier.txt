A barrier is an invisible block that can serve as a better alternative for Bedrock as it is indestructible. Though invisible to players in survival, players in creative while holding a barrier block in their hand will show the barrier blocks as a red slashed circle facing the player's view, although when the player switches to another block the symbol/sign disappears and becomes completely transparent. This effect is in creative only even if players in survival are holding a barrier block, it can't make the barriers to become visible.
Like a few blocks such as the command block for example can only be obtained via commands. By doing   (Note: you do not have to put minecraft with barrier) gives you a barrier block. These blocks are unobtainable in survival unless cheats are enabled and are used.
• It is the only Block that is Invisible In-Game.
• The Barrier Block can help a map builder design a world. For example, he/she can use the block to restrict players from entering that zone, unless of course they're in Creative Mode.
