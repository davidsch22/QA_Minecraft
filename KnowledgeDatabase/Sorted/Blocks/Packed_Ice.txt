Packed ice is an opaque variant of ice. Packed ice is harder than regular ice and can not be seen through.
Packed ice can be found naturally in rare Ice Plains (Ice Spike Biomes) using a tool enchanted with Silk Touch or through creative mode / cheats. Mining packed ice without Silk Touch will break the block.
Packed Ice was added in the update to 1.7.2.
