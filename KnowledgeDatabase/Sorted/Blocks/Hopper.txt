Hoppers are  redstone items added in the Redstone Update, making its first appearance in Snapshot 13w01a. Hoppers have several integral uses, such as moving items that fall on top of it into a chest or other container below or storing it inside of its own storage. Hoppers can essentially be used for automatic grinders and traps that do not need constant attending to. .
Hoppers can also be controlled by redstone. If you power the hopper, it will stop funneling items. When switched again, movement of items will reactivate. The hopper can connect to other hoppers and other containers (chests, furnaces, droppers, etc.) When a redstone comparator is placed next to the hopper it can detect how many items are inside and will output a redstone signal depending on how many items the Hopper has in it (This is same with all other containers if over 22 items in it).
