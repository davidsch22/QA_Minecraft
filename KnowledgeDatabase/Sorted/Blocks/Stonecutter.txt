The Stonecutter is a block in Minecraft Pocket Editon. It is used to make stone related blocks, such as Stone Bricks or Bricks. In a sense, the stone cutter is the exact same thing as a crafting table, and was implemented to avoid over-coding of the crafting table, just for stone stuff. It does have the same icon as a Furnace but with a hammer and a gear texture on one of it's sides as well as one big gear on the top. The Stonecutter is used to craft the following items.
-Granite (and it's polished version).
-Andesite (and it's polished version).
-Diorite (and it's polished version).
-Cobblestone Wall (and it's mossy counterpart).
-Moss Stone.
-Stone, Cobblestone, Quartz and Sandstone Slabs.
-Stone Cobblestone, Quartz and Sandstone Stairs.
-Chiseled Sandstone, Block of Quartz, and Stone.
-Bricks.
- Enchantment Table (0.12.0).
As of October 7, 2015, Tommaso Checchi stated that Stonecutters will be removed from Pocket Edition when 0.13.0 is released. Also stated that 0.13.0 will not be the last Alpha update.
