 The Ender Chest is a block that allows the player to store 27 items much like a wooden chest however, if two Ender Chests are placed down in different places, the items inside chest A will be in chest B. If the items are taken from either chest, both of the chest will not have that item. While on SMP, players will not share the same storage. This can be used to prevent players form stealing more valuable items, as they cannot access the same a items. This also means two players can store items in the same ender chest.
If two Ender Chests are placed and two of an item was put in one, when the chest with the items in is opened, there will be one of the item in that chest and one of the same item in the other chests, acting as an image. This feature also works among the different worlds: Overworld, Nether, and the End. Whenever an Ender Chest is destroyed, it will only drop eight obsidian. If you have a silk touch pickaxe and break an Ender Chest with it, it will drop as an Ender Chest, not just 8 pieces if obsidian.
Due to the fact that any two ender chests in the same world share the same contents, 2 or more ender chests can be used as a "back pack", placing one near your base, loading it with items, and carry a second ender chest with you, essentially increasing your storage space by a chest's worth.
