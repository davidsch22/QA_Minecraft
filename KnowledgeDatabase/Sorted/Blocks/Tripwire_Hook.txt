Tripwire Hooks are redstone-affiliated items in Minecraft. They were first released in the 1.3.1 Update. Tripwire hooks can be placed on the sides of blocks (not the top or bottom and excluding half slabs that are not stacked) and can be armed by placing string on the ground in a horizontal line between two tripwire hooks. If a player or another entity falls or steps on the tripwire when it is activated, it will power the Tripwire Hooks and be able to send a continuous redstone signal as long as an entity or player is over the tripwire. If the tripwire is broken, the Tripwire Hook will send a short current after being deactivated. However, you can safely disarm it by destroying the string with shears. Tripwire Hooks can be found in a jungle temple rigged to arrow dispensers.
If the tripwire hook is armed, when you destroy it, it makes a sound similar to the sound it makes when you release a bow.
A trip wire line can be activated by arrows, once the arrow is picked up the signal will stop. If you're using a dispenser the dispenser will shoot one more projectile when deactivated.
