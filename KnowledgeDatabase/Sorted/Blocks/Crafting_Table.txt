 A Crafting Table, (also called a Workbench), is a useful block used to craft items within a 3x3 grid. When right clicked (default), it allows the player to access the crafting grid. Crafting Tables and Furnaces are able to be pushed by Pistons as of release 1.5.
The crafting table has a 3x3 grid on its top and, on the sides, various tools are depicte (which are unused except for the sound). The underside has a texture that is exactly like that of Wooden Planks.
