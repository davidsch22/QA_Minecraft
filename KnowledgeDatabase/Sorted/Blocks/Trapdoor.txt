 A Trapdoor (also known as a Hatch) is a block used as a horizontal door that fills a one block space. It was introduced in Beta 1.6. When placed outside, rainfall, water, and snowfall do not pass through it, but light can shine through.
They can be placed anywhere with a solid block directly adjacent. When activated, they will then open by flipping upwards, toward the adjacent block. If that block is destroyed, the trapdoor will break off into a resource. Due to this restriction, it is currently not possible to create a flat floor with a trapdoor opening downwards. .
As with Doors, Trapdoors can be controlled with Redstone circuitry. Redstone in its charged state will cause the trapdoor to open. Conversely, redstone in its uncharged state will close the trapdoor.
Sand and Gravel, if dropped onto a Trapdoor, will break into items (similar to how sand or gravel falling on a torch or minecart track will do the same).
Trapdoors can be pushed by a Piston if there's another block for it to connect to or if the block it is currently connected to is pushed with it.
Due to the 12w40a Snapshot, trapdoors can no longer be activated by left clicking. Only right clicking opens/closes trapdoors.
In 1.8 they added Iron Trapdoors to the game, which can be activated only with a redstone pulse, like Iron Doors.
Trapdoors can create air sockets/stop water when placed in any body of water.
In Minecraft Pocket Edition, when a Block is placed down next to the trapdoor, it will activate the trapdoor, just like with Doors. (Fixed).
