Stone, also known as "Smooth Stone" and "Clear Stone," is the most common Block in the Overworld, after Air, in all current game modes. It turns into Cobblestone when mined after Beta, unless using a Pickaxe with the Silk Touch enchantment. Also after Beta, It is possible to turn Cobblestone into Stone by cooking inside a Furnace. Stone cannot be used to make Buttons and Stone Pressure Plates, for Cobblestone is meant to be used in those recipes.
Stone is mostly found at least three or four blocks underneath Grass. StoneÂ is useful because it is an easy material to build with, although it cannot be used for the crafting of tools.

Stone makes up the majority of the solid blocks generated. When chunks generate, stone can be found under layers of grass and dirt in most biomes. It can also be seen exposed at the side of mountains in extreme hill biomes.
