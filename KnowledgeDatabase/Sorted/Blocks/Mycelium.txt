Mycelium is a block similar to grass, and will grow over any dirt in its area. even if it has a sapling or another plant on it, but it is only found naturally in mushroom biomes. This can be stopped by creating an obstruction to the Mycelium's expansion (such as a two-block change in terrain height or a non-dirt solid block). .
Mycelium was first added in the first Beta 1.9 release, useable only in creative mode.
As of 1.2.4, mycelium is the only block players can spawn mushrooms on while in sunlight.
They were added to Pocket Edition in the 0.9.0 Update alongside Mushroom Biomes.
When harvested, it normally drops a dirt block, but with the Silk Touch enchantment, a block of mycelium can be collected.
Players cannot convert mycelium into farmland. It must break and turn it into dirt first.
Mycelium emits particles similar to those underwater and near the Void.
