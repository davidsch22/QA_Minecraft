Cobblestone, the cracked product of mined Stone, is one of the most common Blocks in Minecraft, being found either by mining ordinary stone, or in dungeons that have been generated by the game, along with Moss Stone. It can also be found in strongholds, villages, and jungle temples. Cobblestone doesn't have physics applied to it, so it makes a very good construction material and is used to craft a Furnace. It can be smelted in a furnace to turn it back into Stone. Once Cobblestone is smelted, it becomes considerably weaker than it was before.
Cobblestone is mostly used for creating Furnaces and building shelter. Cobblestone can also be used for Tools, such as Pickaxes, Axes, Shovels, etc. Cobblestone is also used for some weapons, such as Swords. The material is also very blast resistant, being one of the easiest blast-resistant materials to obtain.
