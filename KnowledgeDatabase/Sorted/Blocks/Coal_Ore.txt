 Coal Ore is the most common ore, with the largest vein, in Minecraft and can be found in surface caves and cliffs, and their veins can be found anywhere underground from the dirt layer to the bedrock. On the surface, they are usually found in veins of 3 or 4, but underground they can have as many as 24 per vein and are extremely common. Coal looks just like stone (as seen below), but with black marks in it, making it easy to distinguish from the surrounding stone blocks.
Coal is one of the most important resources in Minecraft (despite being extremely common, being able to spawn in veins of 40 or more) and is essential for the player's first days in a World, as coal can be placed on top of a stick in a crafting table to make torches, which will prevent monsters from spawning in the player's house and help them see.

Coal, similar to Redstone, cannot be compressed into an ore block without the help of the Silk Touch enchantment on a pickaxe. Coal is also the fourth longest lasting fuel for furnaces after lava buckets, Blocks of Coal, and Blaze Rods, respectively, with each piece of coal one able to smelt 8 items and lasting for 80 seconds before burning out. Since lava buckets are hard to obtain and require 3 iron, and acquiring Blaze Rods requires you to kill Blazes, coal is the most efficient fuel to use to smelt items.    .
In an early version of the game, when destroyed without any items coal ore drops a single coal, and three when mined with a pickaxe. Now, destroying coal ore without a pickaxe yields nothing, while destroying it with a pickaxe yields 1 coal.
If obtained in the inventory, Coal Ore can not be smelted in a furnace.
Coal can come in veins of over 20 and with fortune can yield up to 2-3 stacks.
When mined, Coal Ore has a chance to give Experience to the player.
