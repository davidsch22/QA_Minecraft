 Items allow you to perform specific tasks in minecraft, which can range from simply harvesting a block faster, to setting things on fire or changing the colour of wool.
Like blocks, items can be categorized, which is what we’ve done in this guide to make everything easier to find. Note that some items could theoretically be put in more than 1 category, but we’ve only put each item into 1 category to make it easier.
Some items, like tools and armour, have a certain amount of uses before that item breaks. The amount of uses is determined by the materials the tools are made of, and often by the tool itself. The durability of the item will be shown as a small bar at the bottom of the tool’s icon in your inventory, which will shrink each time you use that tool to break a block or attack a mob or player.
It’s possible to repair tools by combining 2 of the same damaged tools in a crafting interface, which will create a new version of that tool with the durability of the old tools combined, plus 10% extra durability, unless the total is more than 100% of the normal tool’s durability. However, any enchantments on the old tools will be lost. Note that you can only combine tools that have been made out of the same materials, so you cannot combine a diamond and iron pickaxe, only 2 diamond or 2 iron pickaxes.
Below is a list of the items in minecraft, but note that some items are shown as a group, instead of each individual item. All tools, for example, are only listed as their type (axe, pickaxe), not as their individual parts (diamond axe, iron axe, ..).
Note that, with the exception of paintings, all items that can be placed as a block, like sugarcane, or all items that act like blocks, like wheat, are not listed. They’re listed in the block list instead.
You can click on each image to get to a seperate page with more info on that item.
These items can be obtained in game through a single action, whether it’s mining an ore block or killing a monster. They are somewhat useless on their own, but can be used to create useful items and blocks.

Eggs.
Eggs are dropped by chickens once every 5-10 minutes, however, the chicken will not drop an egg if you kill it. Eggs are currently only used to create cakes, but they can also be fired by right clicking, which will break the egg on impact. Eggs shot like this will sometimes spawn a chick.

Maps are made using a compass and 8 pieces of paper.
