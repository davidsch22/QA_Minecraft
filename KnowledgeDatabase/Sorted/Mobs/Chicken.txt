 Chickens are passive animal mobs that have existed in Minecraft since Alpha. Chickens are slower than most mobs, but one ability unique to chickens alone, is that they can flap their wings when falling to prevent themselves from taking fall damage.  Chickens will follow players who are holding Seeds, and 2 chickens can be bred with Seeds, which is when they will enter "Love Mode", and spawn a chick directly. Alternatively, chicks can be spawned from Eggs, which adult chickens will lay every 5-7 minutes. This makes chickens the only mob to produce items without being killed.Chick.
Chicks are the baby counterpart of Chickens, and are the third smallest mob in the game. Any time an egg is thrown, there is a 12.5% chance that a chick will spawn, or a 0.390625% chance that 4 chicks will spawn, or you can be sure a chick will spawn by breeding 2 chickens. Chicks will always follow the nearest adult chicken, but cannot swim and will drown in water. Like many baby mobs, chicks have an oversized head.
Feeding chickens wheat seeds (or beetroot seeds, melon seeds and pumpkin seeds in Pocket Edition), will produce a chick. Like other mobs, it will not enter Love Mode for another 5 minutes.
