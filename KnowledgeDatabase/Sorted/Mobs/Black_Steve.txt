Black Steve was a non-hostile passive human mob that was originally a mob in the InDev phase.
Black Steve is one of the four mobs that Dock created, but was pulled along with Rana, Steve, and Beast Boy; the same day Dock left the development team early 2010. Steve and Beast Boy as well as this mob have glided across the landscape due to editors refusing to make their animation.
