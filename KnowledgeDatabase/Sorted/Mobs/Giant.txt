A Giant, or Giant Zombie, is an extremely large, hostile mob. Their model first appeared in Survival Test, but was abandoned. Zombies were originally neutral mobs, and do not attack the player without incite. This is likely due to their near-boss physic and health. They have the same appearance as a zombie, but are several times larger. Their only method of attack is to charge endlessly at the player. Giants have 50 hearts total, half of the EnderDragon's, but still equally deadly. After their removal, they are capable of being spawned with, the /summon command (since 1.7), and third-party programs such as SinglePlayerCommands (SPC). They can ride in minecarts, which will cause a bug. The hitbox on the model itself only includes the Giant's legs; any attacks that make contact above this point will not cause damage, or even hit.
Giants make a fascinating re-introduction into Minecraft, however, they still cannot be created naturally. In snapshot 13w36a, giants can be summoned via the /summon command and you can also spawn the giant via a mod.
If you try to spawn a giant from a spawn egg it can crash your game.
The following video was made by Notch, testing out giants on February 4, 2010.  .
