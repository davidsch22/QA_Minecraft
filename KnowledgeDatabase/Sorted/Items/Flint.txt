Flint is a raw material.
When a block of gravel is mined, there is a 10% chance that a single piece of flint will drop instead of the gravel block. When mined with a Fortune-enchanted tool, this chance is increased to 14% at Fortune I, 25% at Fortune II, and 100% at Fortune III. Gravel mined using a tool with Silk Touch will never produce flint.
Flint can also be obtained by trading with fletcher villagers. They will offer 6-10 pieces of flint for 10 blocks of gravel and an emerald.
Because of the ability to reset the Nether in the Console Editions, flint is renewable in them because gravel can be found in the Nether.
