Sugar is obtained by crafting Sugar Cane. Sugar is needed in the Cake recipe, along with Milk, Egg, and Wheat, and can be used in brewing to create a Potion of Swiftness when brewed into an Awkward Potion. Since Sugar Cane is harder to find in some places, it can be difficult to make Cake. It can also be combined with a Pumpkin and an Egg to make a Pumpkin Pie.
Sugar is a food item derived from sugar canes.
Witches may drop from 0 to 6 units of sugar when killed.
Sugar can be fed to horses to heal 1 (), speed growth rate by 30 seconds, and increase taming probability by 3%.
One of the splash texts on the title screen is "0% sugar!".
