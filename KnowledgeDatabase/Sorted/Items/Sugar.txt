Sugar is obtained by crafting Sugar Cane. Sugar is needed in the Cake recipe, along with Milk, Egg, and Wheat, and can be used in brewing to create a Potion of Swiftness when brewed into an Awkward Potion. Since Sugar Cane is harder to find in some places, it can be difficult to make Cake. It can also be combined with a Pumpkin and an Egg to make a Pumpkin Pie.
