Milk is an item obtained in a Bucket by right clicking a Cow that, unlike other items contained in a bucket, instead of placing it when right clicking, it can be drunk and is considered a food item. Milk is the only food item that will not replenish any hunger by itself, but will instead simply remove all status effects.
3 buckets of Milk, along with other ingredients, can be used to craft a Cake.
Milk was introduced in Alpha, but served no purpose until Beta 1.2, when it became an ingredient for cake.
As of the Adventure Update, milk became an edible food item and a cure for status effects.
After consuming the milk, the an empty bucket will take its place.
