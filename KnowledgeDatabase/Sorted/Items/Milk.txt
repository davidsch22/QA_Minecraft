Milk is an item obtained in a Bucket by right clicking a Cow that, unlike other items contained in a bucket, instead of placing it when right clicking, it can be drunk and is considered a food item. Milk is the only food item that will not replenish any hunger by itself, but will instead simply remove all status effects.
3 buckets of Milk, along with other ingredients, can be used to craft a Cake.
Milk was introduced in Alpha, but served no purpose until Beta 1.2, when it became an ingredient for cake.
As of the Adventure Update, milk became an edible food item and a cure for status effects.
After consuming the milk, the an empty bucket will take its place.
A bucket of milk is an item obtained from cows and/or mooshrooms.
Milk can be obtained from cows and mooshrooms by pressing use while looking at them with an empty bucket.
Holding use with a bucket of milk will start the drinking sound and animation. When consumed it will immediately remove any status effects from the player.
If you drink milk while having nausea, the nether portal animation will show.
