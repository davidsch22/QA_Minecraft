 This farm house is probably one of the first bigger buildings I’ve built, which was quite a long time ago, but I still love it. It’s easy to build, quite compact and it looks great in any area.
I probably use this farm house almost every time I need a farm, so you’ll probably see it a lot in the backgrounds of other builds or projects. In fact, it’s already part of my King of the Hill mini game map.
Most parts of the farm house are very easy to build, so I’ll let the images below speak for themselves. You can click on the image to get a large version.
