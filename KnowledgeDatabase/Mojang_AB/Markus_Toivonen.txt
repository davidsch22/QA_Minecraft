Markus 'Junkboy' Toivonen is Mojang's Art Developer. He can be followed on Twitter and he has a DeviantArt account.
He is quite secretive about his identity, and has only appeared on video as a blue-haired pixelated face. In the Scrolls documentary, his face is blurred, but can be made out as bald. Junkboy's name also appears in Minecraft: Xbox 360 Edition as "No one at Mojang has ever seen Junkboy's face." while maps are loading.
