  The Torch is a type ofÂ tool found in Indev onward since the support for dynamic lighting, and is the simplest placeable source of light, not taking much to craft.
Torches act as if there is no block there, and you are able to walk over it. Being an unsolid block, this even prevents sand and gravel from falling down past a square with a torch on it. Sand or gravel break when they fall on a torch. If they are placed directly above a torch they act as if they were on any other solid material, allowing them to be used as environmental triggers, such as Airlocks. When being placed in water, the torch breaks due to the water closing in on it.
In 1.8, if one pays very close attention to the light emitted by a torch, one can see that it slightly flickers, like a real flame.
If a block falls onto a torch (Sand or Gravel), it breaks the block and gives the player the resource, but the gravel will not drop flint. However, if the torch is placed quickly enough after removing the base of a stack of gravity-obeying blocks, the stack remains in place.
If torches are put near ice, it ultimately melts after a moment.
Torches cannot be put on ice and leaves.
Torches share the same light as a Locked Chest does.
If water or lava flows on top or around the torch, it will be turned into an item.
You can make gravel or sand stay still if there is a torch below it.
Torches were planned to be removed and replaced by lanterns but the lantern was dismissed and the torch is still here.
 If you put a torch on the underside of a block, it will appear on the ground directly below it.                                  .
Before 1.7, naturally generated torches in an Abandoned Mine Shafts would not emit light (This could be fixed by updating a block next to or near the torch, such as placing any item next to it). This is refered to as a Lighting Error.
If Torches are naturally generated in a village (on the pieces of black wool), the Torches have a chance of not being on the Black Wool.
