Hay bales are decorative, flammable blocks that can also be fed to horses.
Hay bales can be mined using any tool, or without a tool.
While not edible by players, hay bales can be a useful compact food supply for long periods away from other food sources.
Hay bales can also be fed to horses, donkeys, or mules to heal up to 10 hearts. They are an effective method to heal horses if the player wants to heal them in a short period of time. They also speed up the growth of foals by three real life minutes.
Hay bales can be placed facing all directions, in the same way as wood and pillar quartz blocks are placed.
Hay bales burn in the world for just as long as the coal blocks do.
Hay bales are the first craftable blocks that can be used to feed an actual mob.
Hay Bales appear green on maps, despite being yellow.
