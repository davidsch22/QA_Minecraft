Bedrock is both an indestructible and unmineable block.
Bedrock cannot be broken using any tools. It also cannot be moved by pistons or destroyed by explosions that are present in normal gameplay. Bedrock can only be obtained by the creative inventory and commands.
Bedrock comprises the bottom-most 5 layers of the Overworld in a rough pattern, although to the 4th layer is predominately flat bedrock with no gaps, which makes the very bottom 5th layer inaccessible.
In the Nether, bedrock comprises both the top and bottom 4 layers in a rough pattern. At the top of the Nether, bedrock prevents you from going past layer 127. It can also be found at the sides of the Nether in the console edition.
Bedrock in the Overworld and the Nether always generates in the same pattern no matter what seed is used.
In the End, defeating the Ender Dragon spawns a portal with a Bedrock frame. A single piece of flaming bedrock also appears underneath ender crystals.

In the console editions, only the lowest layer (and highest in the Nether) of naturally spawned bedrock is unbreakable.
