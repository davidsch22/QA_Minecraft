A carrot is a food item that can be eaten by the player.
Carrots can be farmed and harvested on farmland. Planted carrots take 8 stages to grow, and go through 4 visually distinct stages. Mature carrot crops drop 1 to 4 carrots. Bone meal can be used on carrots. Using a tool enchanted with fortune increases the maximum number of carrots dropped by 1 per level.
Villager farmers will break fully grown carrots, and may pick up the carrots as well.
Rabbits will find and eat mature carrot crops. The crops when eaten will not drop any carrots.
Rarely, zombies may drop a carrot when killed by the player.
Carrots generate naturally as crops in villages.
To eat a carrot, press and hold use while the carrot is selected in the hotbar. Eating a carrot restores 3 () hunger (3 () in Pocket Edition) and 3.6 hunger saturation.
Carrots can also be used to breed and attract pigs and rabbits.
Villagers can pick up carrot items to become willing, which will allow them to breed. Villagers require 12 carrots to become willing.
Villager farmers will buy 15-19 carrots for an emerald as one of their initial tier trades.
