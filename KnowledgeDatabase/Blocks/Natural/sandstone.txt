Sandstone is found in desert biomes, usually in the 1-3 layers under the sand layers. Sandstone is also used for desert wells, which are random wells found in desert biomes. To obtain a sandstone block, a pickaxe has to be used. Destroying it with anything else will completely destroy the block.
Sandstone can also be created with 4 sand blocks in a 2Ã—2 square on any crafting interface. Sandstone can be crafted into smooth sandstone and sandstone slabs, these slabs can then be crafted into decorated sandstone.
