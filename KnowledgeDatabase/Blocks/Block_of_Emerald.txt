Blocks of Emerald (also known as emerald blocks) are decorative mineral blocks.
Blocks of emerald can only be mined using an iron or diamond pickaxe.
Blocks of emerald are often used to store emeralds in a compact fashion, or otherwise used as an expensive construction block.
Blocks of emerald can be used to "power" a beacon. The top layer must be at least 3×3 optional lower layers can be adding as 5×5, 7×7, and 9×9 from top to bottom. The layers do not have to be entirely emerald blocks, as they may also contain blocks of iron, blocks of gold, and blocks of diamond.
