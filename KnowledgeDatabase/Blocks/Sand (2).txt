 Sand is a common physics obeying block that can be found in deserts or next to water. Being a "physics obeying block" means that it will turn into a falling block entity and fall down until it hits a solid block, and turns back into a normal Sand block, or hits a non-solid block and turns into an item. 4 Sand can be crafted into one Sandstone by placing it in a square, or crafted into TNT by combining it with Gunpowder in a checkerboard pattern, and can also be smelted into Glass.
In chunks generated after Beta 1.2's release, the bottom of all Sand piles had a layer of Sandstone.
Before 1.8, the spawn point of a world when created would always be on Sand.
if a block of Sand is placed directly below a block of Soul Sand, it will make walking on the Soul Sand be even slower than it normally would be. This is the same with Ice.
In the Pocket Edition, particles are released by unstable sand.
The ground-block of Desert Biomes is Sand.
Smelting Sand will return Glass.
