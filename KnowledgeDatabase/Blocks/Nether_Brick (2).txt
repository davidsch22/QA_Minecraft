 Nether Brick is a common block found in the The Nether, making up Nether Fortresses.
They were added in the pre-release of Beta 1.9. As such, they are the only readily available source of strong building material in the Nether. Nether Brick can also be used to make a Nether Brick Fence. They are able to be crafted as of 1.5.
The blast resistance of the block is similar to that of Stone Brick. Unlike Netherrack, fire will not last forever on a Nether Brick.
Wither Skeleton spawn on them in Snapshot 12w37a. It also seems to make areas darker.
In Pocket Edition, before 0.12, these were made by smelting the netherrack and creating them at the stoneblock.
