 Cobblestone Walls are a decorative block implemented in the "Pretty Scary Update". They can be used as an alternative to fences, as their hitbox totals 1.5 blocks in height; hence they cannot be jumped over by the player without jump boosts. Like fences, spiders can still climb/jump over. Cobblestone walls can be a more efficient way to fence in mobs since it takes less resources than a Fence. There are 2 kinds of Cobblestone walls, the original cobblestone walls, and the Mossy Cobblestone Wall. Each crafted the same way, but using Moss Stone instead of Cobblestone or vice versa.
