Lapis Lazuli Blocks are a decorative mineral block that is crafted from lapis lazuli. It is a medium blue color, with darker and lighter blue markings on it.
Lapis lazuli blocks can only be mined using a stone, iron or diamond pickaxe.
Lapis lazuli blocks can be used as a form of storage for lapis lazuli.
In real life, Lapis lazuli is a blue gem that may be ground and processed into ultramarine pigment. Lapis lazuli pigment has been famously used in the production of illuminated manuscripts, stained glass, and cave paintings. It was also used by Egyptians for their jewelry and other valuable items (see Wikipedia page).
