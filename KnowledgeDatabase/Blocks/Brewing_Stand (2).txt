 A Brewing Stand is a craftable item in Minecraft used to make potions. When right-clicked, the brewing stand interface shows. The Brewing Stand interface has 4 slots. The bottom 3 slots are for glass bottles. These bottles must be filled with water or a potion. The upper slot is used to brew an ingredient into the potions below. The items which can be used as ingredients on water bottles are: Nether Wart (Awkward potion, the base for other potions), Redstone Dust, Ghast Tears, Glowstone Dust, Gunpowder, Glistering Melon, Magma Cream, Golden Carrot, Blaze Powder, Sugar, Spider Eyes, or Fermented Spider Eyes. .
Brewing Stands will only yield itself if destroyed with a pickaxe. Brewing Stands also have a light level of 1. While distilling a reagent into the glass bottles filled with water or potion, one ingredient will distill into all three slots - e.g. one Nether Wart will create three Awkward Potions.
No matter what kind of potion is in the Brewing Stand, it always looks like a red potion when it's not viewed from the Brewing Stand menu. It's possibly a Harming or a Healing poiton.
If a Brewing Stand is placed on top of a Fence, then the player, and other mobs, can jump onto the fence.
