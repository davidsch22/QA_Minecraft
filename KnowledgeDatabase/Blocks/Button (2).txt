 The Button is a non-solid block that can be interacted with by The Player. It can be crafted with wood or stone. Buttons can be found naturally in strongholds right next to iron doors.
Like torches, buttons can be placed to a side of a dispenser, crafting table, or furnace in the same fashion (done by crouching).
When used with redstone, it can activate mechanism-related items, such as doors, pistons or TNT. When pressed, it will send a short pulse of power (lasting approximately 1.0 seconds, or 10 ticks) to any redstone powered item.
Inside Snapshot 12w34a, a Wood variation of the regular button was added, and is created by placing a Wood Plank anywhere in the Crafting Grid.
In snapshot 14w04a, buttons can be placed on the ceiling and on the floor.
Wooden Buttons have a longer delay than Stone Buttons. Stone Buttons have a 1 second or 10 tick delay, and Wooden Buttons have a 1.5 second or 15 tick delay.
