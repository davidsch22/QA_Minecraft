Blocks of Diamond (also known as Diamond Blocks) are decorative mineral blocks.
Blocks of diamond can only be mined using an iron or diamond pickaxe.
Blocks of diamond can be used to store diamonds in a compact fashion.
Blocks of diamond can be used to "power" a beacon. The top layer must be at least 3×3 optional lower layers can be adding as 5×5, 7×7, and 9×9 from top to bottom. The layers do not have to be entirely diamond blocks, as they may also contain blocks of iron, blocks of gold, and blocks of emerald.
One block of diamond and one wooden log is exactly enough to create a 80% set of diamond tools with one or no sticks left over, depending on if you use a sword or a hoe.
