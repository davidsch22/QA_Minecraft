Glass is a decorative fully transparent block.
Glass will only drop itself if it is broken with a tool enchanted with silk touch; otherwise it will drop nothing.
Villager librarians will trade 3 to 5 glass for 1 emerald as part of their tier 3 trades.
Most blocks dependent on a block cannot be placed on glass. The only exceptions are torches and redstone torches, which can be placed on top of glass, but not attached to their sides.
Glass blocks adjacent to other glass blocks are invisible when viewed through glass.
When placed underwater, glass will appear to have water flowing down it's sides.
