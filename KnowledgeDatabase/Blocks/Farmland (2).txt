 Farmland is a block that is created when you use a Hoe on a dirt block by right clicking. You will want to have the farmland block within at least a 4x4 radius from a Water supply so that when you plant seeds on it they will grow. When the farmland block is next to water, it turns to a dark brown indicating it is moist and plants will grow. When Water is not near, the block will stay a light brown color. When you break a farmland block, you get a Dirt block. You can put seeds on them.
Jumping on farmland would result in it turning back to dirt. Also, before 1.1, walking on farmland would result in it being converted to dirt.
Before 1.2.5, it was possible to obtain farmland through silk touch enchantment. This was removed in 1.2.5.
When planting melon or pumpkin seeds, they don't need farmland to harvest blocks.
You can avoid converting your farmland to dirt by sneaking. This can also be diverted by changing the Mobgriefing setting to false.
Farmland that is near water can go one block away from the source whilst still being fertile for planting.
Farmland can be made while under another block, though it will turn back into dirt as soon as you do.
