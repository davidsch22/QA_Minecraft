Emerald Ore is the rarest block in Minecraft. It first appeared in 12w21a and was finally added in the 1.3.1 update. It can be found in large veins, but usually appears as small single ores. Emerald Ore is 25 times rarer than Diamonds. It drops one Emerald when mined, and is affected by fortune enchantments. They can only be found in Extreme Hill and Roofed Forest biomes. It can only be found rarely in caves in Layer 10. Otherwise, it can be found in layers 4 through 31.
One cavern-network underground in a world will probably hold 5 Emerald Ore blocks each, but separately; rarely in veins.
Emerald Ore is rarer than Emeralds because you can trade with Villagers to get Emeralds.
The ruby ore was replaced by the emerald ore, and was red in 12w21a. This is different as of snapshot 12w21b.
Besides trading with Villagers, Emeralds have no use in making things except Emerald Blocks which are mainly decorational as well, although they are used in activating and fueling Beacons, respectively. Due to these two uses, Emeralds in Minecraft: Pocket Edition are only for decoration until villager trading is released.
It is possible that the possibility (once requirement) of finding Emerald Ore in the Extreme Hills Biome is a reference to the area Emerald Hills in Sonic the Hedgehog 2.
Emeralds were in early versions of Pocket Edition but were removed for having no use. They were implemented again in 0.9.0.
