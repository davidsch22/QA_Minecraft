Moss Stone is a block that resembles cobblestone with moss growing in its cracks.
Moss stone can be mined using any pickaxe. If mined without a pickaxe, it will drop nothing.
Moss stone can be found naturally in dungeons, jungle temples and in the form of scattered "boulders" in Mega Taiga biome.
Apart from use as a durable building block, moss stone can be used to craft mossy cobblestone walls.
