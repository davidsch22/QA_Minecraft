Torches are the main source of light in dark places and at night. They emit a light of level 14, which is 1 level below sunlight. Torches can be found in abandoned mineshafts, villages and strongholds. They’re also created as part of the portal spawned when the Ender dragon dies. Torches are created using sticks and coal or charcoal, each set will create 4 torches. Torches can then be used with pumpkins to create jack-o-lanterns.
Torches can be placed on each side of a block, as well as on top of it. They cannot be placed on the bottom of blocks or on transparent blocks, like leaves and glass. Besides emitting light, torches also emit heat, which will melt snow and ice. Snow blocks do not melt, so torches can be placed on them without any risk. This is very useful in sugar cane farms inside snow biomes.
While torches can be walked through by players and mobs, they act like solid blocks when used with other blocks as you can place blocks on top of torches, including sand and gravel, by clicking the top of the torch. However, falling sand and gravel will turn into items if they fall on a torch. This is often used as traps or as fast ways to harvest large amounts of sand and gravel.
Water and lava will break torches, which make pumpkins, redstone lamps and glowstone a lot more useful. Light prevents hostile mobs from spawning, which makes torches perfect to disable monster spawner. Like the smoke coming off of normal fire, the smoke of torches will go through all blocks. This can be used to create fun effects, like an active chimney. Though it could also tell you where a player’s base might be.
