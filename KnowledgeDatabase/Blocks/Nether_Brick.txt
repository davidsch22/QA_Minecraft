Nether bricks are a block used to form nether fortresses in the Nether.
Nether bricks can be mined using any pickaxe. If mined without a pickaxe, it will drop nothing.
Nether brick forms the walls and supporting pillars of nether fortresses.
Nether brick is non-flammable and immune to ghast fireballs, making it a suitable shelter material for the Nether. When walking on it, it makes the same step sound as stone.
