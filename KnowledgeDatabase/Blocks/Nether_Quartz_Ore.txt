Nether Quartz Ore is the only ore available in the Nether.
The Nether quartz ore block itself (rather than its nether quartz drops) can be obtained by mining it with a pickaxe with the Silk Touch enchantment.
Nether quartz is about as abundant as iron is in the Overworld. However, it appears to be more abundant because there are more exposed caves in the Nether compared to caves in the overworld. It can also be found at any layer. There is an average of roughly 79 ores per chunk. It is not available in Pocket Edition.
Nether quartz ore drops one nether quartz and 2 to 5 experience when mined with any pickaxe. Mining with a Fortune enchanted pickaxe will increase possible yields by 1 per level (up to 4 with level 3).
Unlike netherrack, fire does not burn indefinitely on nether quartz ore.
Nether quartz ore has the same blast resistance as other ores, which is more than the quartz block and netherrack combined.
