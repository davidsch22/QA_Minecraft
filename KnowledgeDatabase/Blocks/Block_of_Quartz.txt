Blocks of Quartz (also known as Quartz Blocks) are mineral blocks that are used only for decoration.
Blocks of quartz can be mined using any pickaxe. If mined without a pickaxe, it will drop nothing.
The texture for the pillar quartz block can be placed sideways facing North/South or East/West.
Because of the low blast resistance of regular quartz blocks, it may be preferable to use two quartz slabs when making fortifications using quartz.
