Carpets are thin blocks which are mainly used for decoration.
Carpets can be mined using any tool, or without a tool. Unlike wool, carpets are not destroyed quicker when using shears.
In Pocket Edition, carpets replace the pressure plates of the tables in villages.
Carpet has the same thickness as a pressure plate. It has a hitbox of ‚ÅÑ16 of a block and covers the entire surface of the block it is placed on, unlike pressure plates.
Carpet can be placed on any block, including non-solid blocks.
Carpet can be pushed and pulled by pistons but will pop off if pushed onto a hole or pulled downwards. It can also break falling sand and gravel.
Mob AI register carpet as an air block, even though mobs are not able to spawn on carpet.
Carpet is an opaque block but does not decrease light going through it. Because of this and the fact that it can be placed on any block, a common decorative strategy is to place carpet on glowstone, illuminating a room and hiding the light source at the same time.
If the player sprints across carpet, the particle effects are those of the blocks that are directly below it.
Carpet will not prevent the formation of ice.
Carpet can safely be placed on top of farmland, although it will not protect the farmland from jumping entities.
