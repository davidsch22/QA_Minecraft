The Block of Coal is a block that was added in the 13w18a snapshot. Like other blocks of its kind, it is a compact way to store the material. It may also be used as a building block, however, it is less appealing than other compacted ores. When first introduced, it had a recolored "Block of Redstone" texture, soon changed to what is it now. Coal blocks were also implemented in the Minecraft 2.0 April Fools update.
Though made from 9 Coal (able to smelt 72 items), one block of coal can actually smelt 80 items, making it a more efficient form of long-term fuel. .
