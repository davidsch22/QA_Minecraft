Pocket Edition Only.
Grass paths are a decorative block currently exclusive to Pocket Edition.
Grass paths can be created by tapping on a grass block with any type of shovel.
Grass paths are naturally generated in villages, where they are used as pathways.
Grass paths are primarily used for decoration. They are a similar color to grass blocks placed in a desert or savanna biome, however a notable difference is they are only ‚ÅÑ16 of a block high.
