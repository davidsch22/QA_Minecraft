End Stone (sometimes called Ender Stone) is a block that appears in the End and makes up most of the dimension.
End stone must be obtained using a pickaxe of any tier, otherwise it drops nothing.
End stone is only found in the End, where it makes up the island. There is a finite amount of end stone on the island.
End stone has a blast resistance of 45, 1.5 times that of ordinary stone. It also cannot be picked up by endermen and cannot be destroyed by the ender dragon.
The end stone can be seen at the bottom of this image, although it has been subjected to a greenish light.
