Redstone torches are an item crafted from one redstone dust and one wooden stick. When placed on its own, it appears as a glowing red torch, noticeably fainter (it can't melt Ice or prevent mob spawning) than a normalÂ torch and without the fire animation. It is used as an endless power source, or as an inverter within redstone circuits.
A redstone torch can provide a power source for "wires". Wires in turn are used to operate doors, pistons, or any redstone-effected block from a distance. The torch can power the wire for a length of 15 blocks, and takes 1 tick in Minecraft world time (approximately 0.1 seconds) for power to flow through it.
The redstone torch will constantly power a set of wires while placed, and is used as a "block-based" switch sometimes. It acts as an inverter, or NOT-gate (and is labeled as such in the game's source code), in redstone circuits, and turns off when any adjacent switch, lever, wire or pressure plate is turned on.
When a redstone circuit comes to a torch, the torch becomes a redstone torch.
