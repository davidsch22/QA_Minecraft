Nether Quartz Ore is an ore that is only found in The Nether.Â Nether quartz ore has a 45% chance of spawning, similarly to iron in the Overworld. When mined with any pickaxe, Nether quartz will drop a Nether quartz that can be used into making daylight sensors and redstone comparatorss. When Nether Quartz Ore was first introduced in 13w01a it couldn't be smelted if obtained by a silk touch pickaxe or via Creative Mode, this was fixed in 13w01b.
Nether quartz ore is the first ore (and possibly the only one) available in The Nether.
Nether quartz ore is the second ore to have a use for redstone mechanics.
Though some people think that glowstone is an ore because it drops glowstone dust, the only ore in The Nether, is Nether quartz.
Unlike Netherrack, Nether Quartz Ore does not burn forever.
