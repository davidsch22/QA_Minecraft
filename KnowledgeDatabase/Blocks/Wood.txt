Wood, also known as logs, is a naturally occurring block found in trees, primarily used to create wood planks. It comes in six species: oak, birch, spruce, jungle, dark oak, and acacia.
Wood can be broken by hand, but using an axe will speed up the process.
Oak wood blocks generate as part of houses in plains or savanna villages. Wood blocks also spawn as supporting beams of witch huts.
Wood blocks of all six types generate naturally as part of trees. Trees can also be grown using saplings.
The following table presents the amount of wood needed to produce an even multiple of a given item with no waste left over, and the quantity produced.
Wood logs can be used as a fuel in furnaces, smelting 1.5 items per block. However, it is far more efficient to craft one of the wood blocks into wood planks: each of the 4 planks will burn as long as the log would have, for a total of 6 items.
The wood blocks are defined by block IDs and block data. They also have block states which may replace block data in the future.
Note that when a wood block is placed, it changes its facing parameters, placing in the direction relative to the block it is placed on.
The block data for wood blocks consists of two facing bits (high-order) and two wood type bits (low-order).

Dark oak and acacia logs share a new block ID separate from the old logs, called log2, because all the other data values on the previous log block were occupied by rotated variants (red sandstone slabs suffered a similar fate). There are still 2 remaining data values on the block that cannot be obtained. The next two trees, if more are added, will likely use these values.
