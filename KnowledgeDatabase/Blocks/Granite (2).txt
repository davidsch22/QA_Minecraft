Granite is a block that was first released in the 1.8 update and 0.9 for MCPE. Normal granite can be found everywhere underground in large chains. It is usually exposed on the surface in Extreme hills, but will generate in other biomes also. If normal granite is placed in a group of 4 at the bottom left part of a crafting table, the outcome will be 4 polished granite. It also was added to the p.e in the 0.9.0 update.
Polished Granite is the smooth product after crafting 4 Granite together.
Granite was released on MCPE before it was to PC.
