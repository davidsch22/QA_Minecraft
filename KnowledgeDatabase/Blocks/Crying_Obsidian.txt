Crying Obsidian refers to a leaked, abandoned project by Jeb to implement a change-spawn obelisk.
This texture was added in Beta 1.3 but was never used in the game. It closely resembles obsidian. It also appears to be a sandstone or a bedrock texture modified to look like obsidian. It is also known as "Bleeding Obsidian" among many members for its appearance when it is actually Crying Obsidian.
Its original intended use was to set a spawn point, but was scrapped with the introduction of beds.
This block can be added to your game through modifications (or, 'mods'), although these blocks will not appear in multiplayer worlds unless the multiplayer server has the same mod installed.
In Beta 1.5, the texture slot for crying obsidian was replaced by a grayscale replacement of the side of grassy dirt blocks, which is used for biome-compliant grassy dirt block sides, such as Mycelium.
