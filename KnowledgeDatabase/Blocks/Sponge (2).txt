Sponges absorb water source blocks around themselves. The .
sponge must be directly touching a water source to absorb water, and will only absorb water connected to an adjacent water block touching the sponge.

Placing an empty bucket in the Fuel Slot of the furnace while smelting the wet sponge will fill the bucket with the "evaporated" water. (1 bucket for each wet sponge). .
 A wet sponge will "drip" water if placed in world. .
