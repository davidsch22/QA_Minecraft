Dead bushes (also known as shrubs) are transparent blocks in the form of an aesthetic plant.
Dead bushes do not drop anything unless shears are used. Also, they do not spread, and cannot be grown using bone meal. If the block below the dead bush is removed, the bush will simply disappear without dropping anything.
Dead bushes will generate on sand, red sand, podzol and hardened clay in deserts, mesas, mega taigas and swamps.
The only use for dead bushes is for aesthetic decoration. They can be placed into flower pots.
There is a variant of grass called "Shrub" that looks identical to the dead bush, but will occasionally drop seeds and is randomly offset from the center of the block like grass. It can be obtained using /give @p tallgrass 1 0 <dataTag>.
