The Crafting Table (originally called Workbench) is one of the most essential blocks in Minecraft.
Crafting tables can be mined with any tool, or without a tool, but the axe is the quickest.
Crafting tables generate naturally in libraries in villages and witch huts.
Pressing use on a crafting table placed in the world will open the 3Ã—3 crafting grid which allows you to craft more items than with the crafting grid in your inventory.
If you disconnect, move more than eight blocks away or close the crafting interface the items inside will drop in front of you.
When used as a fuel in a furnace, a crafting table lasts 15 seconds (or 1.5 items).
Note: This video is outdated as crafting tables now also generate in witch huts.
The underside of the crafting table has the same texture as oak wood planks.
The old icon for Minecraft (not the launcher) is a crafting table. The Mac version uses the old icon instead of the new icon, which is a Grass Block.
