Gold ore is one of the rarest types of mineral blocks found underground.
Gold ore will drop as an item if mined by an iron or diamond pickaxe. If mined by any other tool, it will drop nothing.
Gold ore generates in veins of 4-8 blocks (sometimes up to 16 if two veins happen to spawn together, and as few as 1 if the block that was supposed to be gold ore is occupied by a generated structure). It only appears in the bottom 32 layers of the map. From levels 2-29, gold ore's occurrence underground is at 0.1437% (about five times as rare as iron). On average there are 8.2 gold ores per chunk.
However, in Pocket Edition, gold generates at any height in mesas.
