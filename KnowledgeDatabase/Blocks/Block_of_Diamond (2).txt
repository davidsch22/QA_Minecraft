A Block of Diamond is a Block that first appeared within Indev and can be obtained by crafting nine Diamonds together with a Crafting Table. Diamond Blocks can only be mined successfully with an Iron or Diamond Pickaxe. To get the Diamonds back, simply put the Diamond Block on any block in the Crafting Grid to split it into 9 Diamonds. Diamond Blocks can be used for a pyramid for a Beacon, and for stronghold walls, but because Diamond is hard to obtain in large quantities, this is not practical.
They serve as decoration, compact storage for Diamonds, and a way to power Beacons.
