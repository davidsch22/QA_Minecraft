Slabs are highly blast resistant half blocks used for building that generate naturally in Strongholds and Villages and are crafted in sixes with any of 8 different materials by making a horizontal line of 3 full blocks of the material being used in a Crafting Table. Slabs of the same type can be stacked to make full blocks, which sometimes look the same as the regular block, but sometimes look different.

Sandstone, Wood, and Cobblestone slabs were added in the Beta 1.3 update on February 22, 2011.

Unless Water is flowing directly down on a Slab, a slab will block water flow regardless of the space above it.
Before 1.3.2 Wooden Slabs' ID was a variant of Stone Slabs', so you needed a pickaxe to break wooden slabs. However, this still occurs on the Pocket Edition.
In the Joke Update Minecraft 2.0, a new slab known as the Etho Slab was added. The name was a reference to the Minecraft YouTuber, EthosLab. This slab version of TNT would have a larger blast and if a player is close enough, will spawn an anvil above them.
